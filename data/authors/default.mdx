# You've reached the About page at jenchan.biz!

Artist turned developer, retired academic, programming journeyperson on a path of chronic self-improvement.

I enjoy building things with people: events, software, art projects, and of course, dinner parties.

I've worked at 2 agencies, 3 startups, 1 enterprise, 2 universities, several non-profit galleries, 3 internships, and a ramen shop.

I used my experience across arts admin, curating, canvassing, and grassroots activism to scale TorontoJS from 8000 to 17000+ combined members with a rotating cast of 4 organizers and 40 volunteers.

In a past life, I taught and wrote about digital literacy, art and culture.
