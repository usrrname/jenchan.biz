title: Stupid work
draft: false
summary: Work that is not worth doing but you have to do it anyway

This is the work that does not add value, wastes time, and doesn't improve the product or process, but is necessary to do in order to reach delivery.

A non-exhaustive list:

- rework or n+=1 revisions for code review approval beyond the reach of reasonable requests
- recommendations for effort, triage and prioritization when a bug is actually missing requirements or a feature request
- status updates for different audiences
- ticket writing
- checking Jira ticket status automation has indeed updated the progress to the correct status
- estimations without clear requirements
- ass-covering documentation or test plans with screenshots and videos proving you did the work or testing
- time logging and task tracking
- clarifying where to store docs
- code review and testing without any description of the original requirements, ticket or bug to fix
