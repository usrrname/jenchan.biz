The kind where you can't validate the problem or solution, and no one will give you more info besides "it doesn't work", nor will the team provide access to the internals or reproduction. So you scaffold a side project mocking the subsystem to figure out what might be the problem to inform your suggested solution because you need them to buy into your department's integration anyway.
