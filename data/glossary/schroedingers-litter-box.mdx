You don't know whether the cat is in the box. You don't know whether the cat crapped in the box, so you write code defensively and abstractly enough to account for the cat or the crap potentially being in the box. There's a chance both are discovered to be unnecessary for the solution when the client or partnering team finally provides access or takes over integrating.
