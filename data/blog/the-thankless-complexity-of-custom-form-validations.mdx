One of the least exhilarating but common development tasks are building forms, and form validations. While important, they're often over-designed and easy to over-engineer as a result.

I believe we've gone too far with trying to accomodate _all_ kinds of form validation while building reusable input fields â€“â€“ especially for component libraries and design systems.

## The Browser Already Handles It

<figure>

 <figcaption className="text-left"> Default HTML5 on-submit validation in Chrome. This is what happens when the submit event is called on a form and the incorrect data or required fields are not filled as a result of the HTML [constraint validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) calling `checkValidity()` on [ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) or `form.validate()` methods.</figcaption>
</figure>

The most basic validation happens on submit, when the user hits a "submit" button associated with a form element.

It's not styled nicely. It doesn't look or feel consistent look across browsers, but **IT JUST WORKS**.

Form input elements have [built-in validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation) [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation#validation-related_attributes) for `min`, `max`,`step`, `minlength`, `maxlength` values, and regex matching on the `pattern` attribute for things like phone number format masking.

If you stick to validating on submit, could very well validate a form without using Javascript![^1]

The drawback: errors that show up from failed submission attempts won't disappear til the user retries submitting the form.

## All the ways to validate

Each type requires invoking validation on the form field at different moments of the user journey.

- Validation as the user interacts with a field (`oninput`, `onchange`, `onkeypress`). Also called "**live validation**".

    strength meter under the field provides instant feedback on whether the
    user's password fulfills password rules.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Validation that runs when the user pauses, or has finished typing in a field (`onkeyup` with debounce) is less common besides finding them on username and password fields. I don't think it's necessary to including such behaviour on regular input fields in component libraries.

- Validation that runs **on submission** (`onsubmit`) - and should prevent any erroneous data being posted if there are errors in any form field.

- Validation that shows on fields **after form submission** due to responses from the server

  One would expect that post-submission, server-side errors are reflected on the form, under corresponding fields that had incorrect content.

- Validation that runs **right after** the user has interacted with the field (`onblur`) - otherwise called "late validation"

Unpopular opinion: I recommend sticking to this when there is a need to build ultra-fast. You will dig your own grave otherwise.

Agreeing to implement live validation, if not scoped carefully, will result in hellfire from all directions since:

- validation can run [prematurely and aggressively](https://baymard.com/blog/inline-form-validation#pitfall-1-premature-inline-validation), especially on fields that are required but incomplete.

- you'll be playing whackamole to remove validation errors whenever they're corrected, which means detecting change `oninput` or `onkeypress` and removing the error message when the field is valid again, particularly on fields that are dependent on each other.

- you end up tempted to add more feedback mechanisms like toasts to prove the form submitted

## Treacherous Variants

Let's look at some well-intentioned UX patterns that explode the combinatories of visual and accessiblity testing since form layouts are so varied.

2. Showing validation errors inside a tooltip or popover

3. Showing **multiple** validation messages above, below, adjacent to any form field ðŸ˜±

4. The heavily debated best practice of indicating required inputs with an asterisk, OR appending "(required)" to the field label, OR only showing "(optional)" next to optional field labels.

5. Showing a summary of form errors at the top or bottom of the form on-submission

## To Make a River Flow Backwards

Developers easily do more absurd work to make validation possible.

2 examples of how garden-variety form fields grow more complex than they should be:

### Live validation, all the time.

Until a year ago, developers had to deliberately prevent live validation from running on page load if it was a requirement.

When the form is first rendered, the fields are empty, and immediate check on validation by browser APIs will show the `:invalid` styles on the fields with the `required` attribute set.

<iframe
  height="300"
  className="w-full"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Types of validation using validation constraint, psuedo :invalid, user-invalid, :aria-invalid"
  src="https://codepen.io/usrrname/embed/preview/VYZrMww?default-tab=html%2Cresult"
  frameBorder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowTransparency={true}
  allowFullScreen={true}
></iframe>

We'd have to tell the form **not** to display invalid styles, especially those with the `required` attribute set while validating empty fields on initial page load. Alternately, we might opt to prevent live validation from happening until the user interacts with a field after initial page load.

Luckily, the `:user-valid` and `:user-invalid` pseudo-class CSS selectors just reached [baseline status](https://web.dev/articles/user-valid-and-user-invalid-pseudo-classes) in 2023, so we can style the form fields based on user interaction instead of [`:invalid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid), which reflects field element's validity.

### Showing **multiple** messages above and below a form field

We'll just conditionally render more icon-message molecules as they arise :p

<figure className="flex content-center">
  <img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc97e285-e9b4-4c78-befe-949032b8057f/password-strenght-meter-airbnb.png"
    alt="Screenshot of a password validation scenario where vitaly.friedman@gmail.com is entered into an email form field, and an obfuscated four-character password is entered into a password field. The area below the password field shows validation requirements of the password field. The first is an error declaring the password strength is weak. The second is a success message confirming that the password can't contain the user's name or email. The third is an error stating that the password should be at least 8 characters. The fourth is a success message about the password containing a number or symbol."
    className="max-w-[320px] text-center"
  />
</figure>

Displaying multiple inline validations on columned form layouts with multiple fields in a row causes layout shifts and misalignment when space the element occupies dynamically changes whenever the validation message appears.

## Avoid all-in-one solutions

Can you imagine a text input component that on top of its usual props, includes a littany of optional props or attributes like `validationMessagePosition`, `isContentVisible`, `showValidationInTooltip`, `validationTooltipPosition`? Yuck. (I recall this [AirBnB talk](https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHQ1WSx41CA?si=fV1r5lENFsYZv6sQ&start=1299) about how a button component festered in attempt to support all variants.)

If you're working on a design system, developer adoption of form elements will require clear working examples of how inputs will interact with form elements to show validation - especially if you're supporting multiple frameworks.

Before you build, clarify base cases that you're supporting with and spend time solutioning for how users can extend form elements.

It may look smart to build the all-knowing form element that will alternate between displaying the correct visual features for numeric, text, currency types in a single field, and conditionally render the right input... right?

**IT'S A TRAP** â€“ even if many attributes between number and text inputs are similar.

## Be Skeptical of New Wheels

If you think you're being clever by designing or building the world's best datepicker with custom fields? Think again. There's a reason why `<input type="date"/>` exists.

The value it gathers is a `"YYYY-MM-DD"` string but `valueAsNumber` returns an easily parsable unix epoch timestamp.

Any further efforts to invent this pattern leads to exponential efforts with testing and maintenance. Are you gonna go to market or what?

## Custom validation: the developer's dilemma

Careful separation between the presentational and functional responsibilities of different input fields, building mechanisms to accept validation rules, and offering users mental models of how to achieve custom validation with abstractions is vital to developer adoption of form elements.

The best kind of validation you're going to offer is the kind that you won't have to write.

Most developers who have to cram-build forms have a stack-based favorite for runtime validation. Most libraries do this in some way with a config object or wrapping the native `ConstraintValidation` properties.

- Angular's forms has the dirty and touched flags. uses `Validators` and `FormControl`

- For Vue or Nuxt, [Formkit](https://formkit.com/essentials/validation) offers `validation-config` props for declaring validation type on the `<form>` and `<input>` level. It accepts an object of ids and errors which can be reactively updated to include any errors that are pertinent to the form state. The `@formkit/zod` plugin allows Zod to be used for runtime validation.

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) uses `useForm` and `useField` hooks to manage form state and validation.

For cases that require showing multiple validations, publishing examples of how users can customize and extend existing components to achieve their goals while integrating with their stack's ecosystem would be a path of lesser resistance than ensuring every field packs in all possible validation scenarios.

## Web components: The special snowflake

Implementing [Form Associated Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html) (aka. form element web components) can be frustrating when there are no dominant patterns established on writing web components for reuse, particularly when there is a need to expose the `ValidityState` API to enable the display of multiple, conditional errors.

Look at how much vanilla code you'd have to write to make an input field that shows a custom error message when a required field isn't populated!

## Make it harder for users to screw up

Data entry is a means to an end: collecting data allows teams to improve the product or enable users to acheive their goals.

We're challenged to imagine how users might have an easier time with data entry.

The sooner and more validation errors you show, the more punishing it is for the user, the higher the abandonment rate.

As developers our everyday work should not just be to solve user problems, make their lives easier, but to right-size the solution for the problem we're trying to solve.
