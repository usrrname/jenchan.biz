1. `npm install express` and latest version of node
1. Get server running first. Resist urge to write more code without testing
1. Make `api` and `public/app` folders
1. Make .gitignore to ignore `node_modules` and `config.js`
1. `npm install —-save-dev` for dependencies
1. `npm init` to create a package.json
1. Make a server.js file with routing ‘/’ to res.send “hello world”
1. Make a router.js file to use express/express.Router() to handle get and post requests. Include body.parser
1. Test using Postman
1. Write a mongo.js file to abstract mongo connection to rest of app
1. Write a schema, test it with one key-value pair
1. If using mLabs, remove `localhost` and port info from `mongo.js` and insert mlab uri in config.js
1. Test on Postman
