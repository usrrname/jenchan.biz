Working on a living product after 2 years on design systems and component libraries has inspired reflections on technical choices of startups past.

In this post, I recount some learnings from using or refusing common, "boring", [flux-informed](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/) stores for managing application state.

üçø The following is a tale of 3 front end architectures spanning 2018-2024, each with a different stack and state management solution in a regulated domain. [^1]

## 1. The fintech app with several thousand trial users

The Stack: React 14, React-Redux, Yup, Bootstrap, Express, MongoDB, Redis

</div>

My first encounter with sophisticated store usage was React-Redux at a B2B fintech company in 2019. We were using React 11 for dual-module application, its state all sewn together by several [`connect()`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) functions.[^2] 
 
Redux solved the need for a view-level source of truth to organize feature-specific state, especially when different parts of the app needed to access information specific to a particular feature. 

The following is a simplistic view of feature states to enable the user to add stocks to portfolios, and contact customer service. 

Each feature has its own reducer, and the store combines them all.

![A diagram of a mega-store with feature-oriented reducers](/static/images/blog/fintechmegastore.png)


```javascript
// store.js
const configureStore = () => {
  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer: {
        account: accountReducer,
        stock: stockReducer,
        support: supportReducer,
    }
 ...
  );

  return store;
};
``` 
The plans reflect these business requirements: 

- the ability to find and add stocks to one‚Äôs own portfolio
- the view and compare the progress of purchased stocks
- the ability to privately discuss stock choices with customer support agents

Just as you wouldn't make an API call to the server every time you need to display data, a store acts as an intermediary space for storing and manipulating presentational data. `POST` or `DELETE` requests to your server could then be made as needed and responses would also update the store.

With each app feature having its own store, operations around specific modules are easier to maintain ...as long as we plan carefully.

## 2: Modernizing a surgery prioritization system in Angular 9

The Stack: Angular 8, [Dynamic forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/dynamic-forms), RxJS, and Angular Material, FHIR Server

![A patient intake form](https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/14411927/file/original-b1ec7a14d5ed923ab01675e05fa78b56.png)

After the fintech stint, I landed at a health tech company whose forte was clinical data storage but they were trying to make headway on health apps. On one of their projects, my team was tasked to rewrite a legacy .NET surgery prioritization system into an Angular 9 app for a provincial health organization. Their primary users would be hospital admin staff.

The app would take the combination of answers entered into a single-page 8-part form with 120 fields assess how soon a patient had to undergo a surgery for a health condition.

It's not as serious as a medical device, but impactful to patient health outcomes to the extent the app decides who gets a brain scan before whom. 

![Angular architectural diagram of model view controller](https://ducmanhphan.github.io/img/Angular-architecture/angular-architecture.jpg)

Angular‚Äôs MVC structure meant service classes performed the passing of state between views. 

Our form was doubly-dynamic: 
- fields that were displayed depended on a question-answer model, basically running through `Formbuilder` 
- subsequent fields that were displayed were dependent on combinations of inputted values of other fields

Oh yeah, stakeholders decided that each field had live, `oninput` validations that were dependent on the values of other fields.

Doesn't this sound like it's ripe for a state management solution?

Well, **we didn't use one**.

Instead, we used observables with RxJS to subscribe to streams of async event data, and used service classes to pass data between views. 

What happens if when only use services to share state?

```javascript
// question.service.ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class QuestionService {
  getPatientIntakeQuestions(): QuestionBase<string>[] {...}

  getPatientProcedureHistory(): QuestionBase<string>[] {...}

  getPatientEncounterHistory(): QuestionBase<string>[] {...}
}
```

What happens when you only use services to share state?

- Service classes get longer and longer with custom methods to check for specific conditions.

- State was transient and could only be debugged through inline console logs

Where you had conditional adding of fields you'd have to loop through form groups to check whether an `AbstractControl` on a particular nested form group form value had been interacted with.

Conditionally rendering fields and validations according to selected form values all relied on runtime checks against a JSON file with 280 combinations of custom form validation rules.

Form state could only be inspected at runtime by console logging different lines within and after functions, but not in any devtool particularly painful when it came to debugging regressions or checking our own work.

- Business logic starts creeping into controllers, and lines blur for where to put functions that load and update state or cause side-effects.

- Abuse of post and fetch requests to keep the form state updated in the absence of a sink to hold the state

At the time, Angular didn't have standalone components and we didn't know about Angular Universal's capabilities of SSR.[^3] We made multiple API calls sequentially to fetch and populate form questions and previous answers after login, instead of server-side rendering the form statically.

Due to the length of the form, there was a requirement to save any answers up to point it had been filled. I forget what we did, but `LocalStorage` wasn't an acceptable solution due to the sensitivity of patient health information. It's likely we posted the "auto-saved" versions at idle intervals to a different endpoint.

```javascript
// dynamic-form.component.ts
export class DynamicFormComponent implements OnInit {
  form: FormGroup;
  constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder, private questionService: QuestionService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.form = this.formBuilder.group({
      patientIntake: this.formBuilder.group({
        questions: this.questionService.getPatientIntakeQuestions()
      }),
      patientProcedureHistory: this.formBuilder.group({
        questions: this.questionService.getPatientProcedureHistory()
      }),
      patientEncounterHistory: this.formBuilder.group({
        questions: this.questionService.getPatientEncounterHistory()
      }),
      patientSurgeryHistory: this.formBuilder.group({
        questions: this.questionService.getPatientSurgeryHistory()
      }),
      ...// and on and on and on...
    });
  }
  ...
  onInputChange() {
    // check if a field has been dirtied
    // check if a field is part of a formgroup that should have an instance added
    // invoke live validation for form fields
    // show the errors above form fields
  }
  ngOnSubmit(){
    // loop through all forms 
    // show the form level validation errors above the form
  }
  onSubmit() {
    // the actual form submission post request
    this.formService.submitForm(this.form.value).then(...
    // notify user of any response errors
    )
  }
}
```
App architecture wise, we had some weird hybrid between modules separated by domain and angular's "shared" folder structure. 

Dynamic forms and reactive forms fulfilled the need to render different form data models, but this got tacky as soon as we needed to:

  - conditionally render nested form groups or fields
  - display previously entered information or conditionnally disable previously filled fields
  - add another field instance to a form when it's edited or filled
  - validate form fields based on the values of other fields

The disaster that arose from not using a state management solution: longwinded, overly imperative ("if-abc, else if xyz, else if jkl..."), and much harder to maintain and debug code. 

## 3: A 7 year old shopping app that was never refactored

The old stack: Nuxt 2, Vue 2, VueX, Tailwind, Vercel, MySQL, Laravel

The new stack: Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Pinia, Tailwind, Cloudflare pages, MySQL, Laravel

In the past year, I've been working on migrating Vue 2 and VueX to Vue3 and Pinia in Nuxt 3 for an e-commerce app.

Imagine an app for boutique knick-knacks starts by hydrating a user store with all the info related to a user whenever they login.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/nuxty-2-shoes-wh7mlv?embed=1&file=%2Fstores%2FaccountStore.ts"
    className="w-full h-[600px] border-0 border-radius-4 overflow-hidden"
     title="nuxty-2-shoes"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

At the beginning, the business only runs in Canada. It's good enough to have everything in one single store. 

Later, this app decides to expand in the US and also sell American goods, and offer specific coupons and promotional discounts to American users.

Developers logically decide they need to create an order store to handle the possibility a user may shop in different currencies and payment methods (A contrived example, but not far from what I've seen in the wild).

The specific project team hurtles to roll out a new store for American orders, but still keep the original one to handle Canadian orders.

### What could go wrong?

![Animated talking muppet gif reading "Still... [chuckles] what could go wrong?"](https://y.yarn.co/89a9cea5-cd47-4dbb-843b-c2683e748392_text.gif)

The store is definitely split into modules that pertain to domain features, but it has a couple oddities:

- Mismatching or similarly named state properties and actions. `orderStore().confirmOrders()` and `accountStore.purchaseItems()` perform the same function, but they're in different stores. The `accountStore` has an `items` property that tracks `order.data.items` in the cart pre-checkout, but so does the `orderStore` for `orderStore.items` in the cart, post-checkout!

- Duplicated state: while the account store would be populated with user-adjacent info right after login, the order store is updated whenever it's instantiated in American users' sessions.

- Missing knowledge sharing: Many features of the app still rely on the legacy `order.data.items` property, but the `orderStore`'s `order.items` inventory needs to be displayed in US currency. Without cataloging and updating areas that rely on the old store, the display of the correct cart continues to falter. 

- Getter abuse: The `accountStore` has getters that detail trivial pieces of user state that have been tacked on over time: 

  - `isSubscribedToNewsletter()` is already denoted by the property `user.hasSubscribed` returned from the API call. 
  
  - `isVegetable()` might be helpful for vegetarian users, just as  `ordersWithoutPeanuts()` would for all cart items without peanuts, and might have been a feature request quickly implemented to serve those with allergies, but not needed by all users. These two would be better off as computed properties in a `useDietaryRestrictions()` composable.
  
- neither of the stores are fully migrated to Vue 3 composition API.

And so, the more features added, the busier the team gets with patching and reconciling state in both stores üò±

Eventually someone has to rip the bandaid off in order to move ahead:

- retire the use of `accountStore` and relocate Canadian and American orders to show under `OrderStore`

- If the separation is worth the longterm sustainability of the app, then 2 stores might co-exist independently with the same data:

  - we can get the second store to subscribe to the first on load, then on state change, dispatch the actions in the second store.
  - OR, we get rid of hydrating the first store and instead hydrate the second on load so we won't have to keep 2 stores' data in sync.

## What people hate about stores

### Setup drudgery and boilerplate

The amount of code needed to set up a store, actions, reducers and dispatchers can be overwhelming for newcomers. The learning gradient for Redux and VueX is particularly rough for programming newcomers. 

![Diagram displaying the state management model for a Vue library](/static/images/blog/vuex-diagram.png)

<figcaption>VueX itself is particularly verbose with introducing the need to commit mutations before dispatching actions.</figcaption>

To be effective with stores, developers needed profiency with a framework's rendering mechanisms consider the tradeoff of strenuous setup and boilerplate for the benefit of shared state between views.

Every action had to be created and dispatched via the reducer, and any container view using the store had to be connected to it. I don't recall how many times I wrote `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.

Redux as a choice is rather overkill in today's front end ecosystem if you're building an MVP, and as of late more have been using [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) or `useReducer` to update slices of state.[^4]

### Premature optimization leads to higher maintenance efforts

It can be tempting to create a store for every feature of an app too soon. This can result in unnecessary complexity or abstraction that's easy to overlook by newer devs when they're not familiar with the pattern. 

Premature codesplitting confuses the team when the data source is the same, leading to higher cognitive overhead to keep more stores' state updated, especially if they share the same data source.

The more stores you have, the more state you have to keep track of!

## To store or not to store?

Using a store for state management is ideal when:

- There is complex, domain-specific logic that needs to be diligently updated as part of a larger product or platform as a user navigates through different views.

- It's become unsustainable to manage state within one or two components and you find that you're requesting or passing the same data properties across multiple components. (aka. [prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling))

- There's a need to present or update different types of data across different features of an app, or work with nested deep data structures to update the UI.

If there are multiple dimensions of state to track, a store might not provoide enough granularity. It may be worth looking at implementing a state machine (some libraries include [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) or [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/))
   
For example, if you need interaction changes through multi-step forms, wizards or like the combinatories of form fields I previously described. 

_Caveat: I have not had to use above libs yet._

It's easy to get to a place where no single pattern is used, but someone somewhere, at some point is going to take issue with whether you use:

- [Container-component pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/presentational-container-pattern/)

- a [provider](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/provider-pattern) that encapsulates state and actions for a component tree (the basis for Context API)

- an [observer-style](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/observer-pattern) event bus,

- a [singleton](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/singleton-pattern) that can be updated from anywhere in the app (React Context and Vue composables might be lightweight ways to do this, but I have found that composables are not good replacements for behaviour you'd expect from singletons.)

## Contemporary state management

Front end frameworks today have more lightweight and facile options for managing state. Often times, the built in mechanisms of a framework are enough to handle the state of a small to medium-sized app, and definitely not even a concern for most marketing sites.

Hooks in React 16.8 and further allowed devs to separate out local, global state. Custom hooks built with bread-and-butter `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` made encapsulation of reactive business logic much easier.

The [Context API](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) vastly reduced the need for prop drilling by being able to refer to context values anytime at any level of view depth within a component. 

Leveraging the [provider pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/provider-pattern/), context helped make state accessible from any level of an app. 

Vue's `computed()`, `ref()` and `watch()` functions and composables allow us to accomplish the same things as React `useState` and `useEffect` in hooks and context in a local component.

And even newer, sexier options: [signals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) -currently only available in Svelte and Angular- will be making it into Javascript.

The problems I see frameworks solving for are the same: 
- the need to reactively update the UI when data sources change, 
- the need to subscribe and unsubscribe to changes in data sources,
- managing side effects: to handle or mitigate behavioral changes in response to user actions
- to draw clean lines between state changes that should be local to components, shared across components, or global to the app.

On large and rapid-moving projects, clean state management becomes a moving target. If you're able to motivate and inspire others on ways to manage complexity amongst the chaos of business pressures, I applaud you.

But where you need it, choose a strategy to manage the entropy before it turns into unreadable spaghetti!
