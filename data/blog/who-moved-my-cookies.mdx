Yes, it's 2025, we had the internet and the encyclopedic knowledge of LLMs at our fingertips, and we were still blocked for 45 minutes.

## The Problem

Imagine, it's possible for a gaming platform to have all of these namespaces:

- `addictinggames.com`
- `fun.addictinggames.com`
- `cool.addictinggames.com`

And other mirror domains could also receive its traffic in the event some of them got blocked by parental controls or libraries, or some no-fun workplaces want to prevent people from playing fun games:

- `addictinggames.wtf`
- `addictinggames.lol`
- `evenmoreaddictinggames.com`
- `playaddicting.fun`

Such a system was set up so that if Johnny was logged in at `addictinggames.com` but his mom decided to block access to the site, he'd would be able to use `addictinggamesmirror.com` to redirect his session to `addictinggames.wtf` and continue playing there. ✌

So, we were going to launch a web 3 game at a subdomain, `even.more.addictinggames.com`... with the intention that sessions could be persisted to `even.more.addictinggames.wtf`, `even.more.additinggames.lol`, so on and so forth.

How hard could it be?

It was impossible.

We had previously used subdomains and mirror domains to persist user sessions for authenticating users.

The cookie was just proof that the user was still authenticated -amongst other things- after a redirect.

While all other areas of the platform showed that a user who had logged in and went back to the view was still authenticated, the proxied request returned nothing.

## What we tried

We of course did the usual cookie clearing, logging out and logging in and checking the dev tools.

We checked that there wasn't anything on the client side that was setting or eliminating the cookie –an anti-pattern anyway.

Since the cookie was HTTP-Only, there wouldn't have been any way for the client to access it.

We checked that the cookie was being set on the server side.

We compared headers from the proxied request and the original request.

We tried desperately to specify the destination domain for `Set-Cookie` to be `*.addictinggames.com` or `even.more.addictinggames.com`.

Our manager pointed us to the MDN docs on [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

As it turns out:

> If the Set-Cookie header does not specify a Domain attribute, the cookies are available on the server that sets it but not on its subdomains. Therefore, specifying Domain is less restrictive than omitting it. Note that a server can only set the Domain attribute to its own domain or a parent domain, not to a subdomain or some other domain.
> So, for example, a server with domain `foo.example.com` could set the attribute to `example.com` or `foo.example.com`, but not `bar.foo.example.com` or `elsewhere.com` (the cookies would still be sent to subdomains such as `bar.foo.example.com` though).

See [RFC 6265 Section 4.1.2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.2.3) on "HTTP State Management Mechanism".

## One does not simply set a cookie on a subdomain

✅ We could expect that a server that responds with the `Set-Cookie` header and no `Domain` specified, would only set the cookie to the host server of the document, but not at subdomains.

✅ We could expect that a server responding with the `Set-Cookie` header and `Domain` specified to `addictinggames.com`, would allow `addictinggames.com` and subdomains like `fun.addictinggames.com` to receive the cookie.

✅ We can also use the `Set-Cookie` header to set a `Domain` attribute to `fun.addictinggames.com` and expect the cookie to be set when visiting `fun.addictinggames.com`.

❌ We can't use the `Set-Cookie` header to set a `Domain` attribute to `even.more.addictinggames.com` or `even.more.addictinggames.wtf`.

So it follows that it would be another magnitude of problematic to expect such a cookie to persist on an external mirror subdomain like `even.more.addictinggames.wtf`.

## The Solution

Sometimes web APIs defy logic.

Don't try to set cookies on a subdomain-of-a-subdomain. Just stick with one level or the parent domain.

Instead of dark-launching on `even.more.addictinggames.com`, we went with `more.addictinggames.com`.

Ta-da!
