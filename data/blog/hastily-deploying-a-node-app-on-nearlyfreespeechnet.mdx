This was so intimidating that I'm just recording what I did so I can remember. Thanks to Conan Lai @letmelol for onsite assistance and [this Mopsled blog from 2015](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108020800/http://www.mopsled.com/2015/run-nodejs-on-nearlyfreespeechnet/), which you should really read instead of my post which only details the terminal commands I used.

# Getting started

(For more info [See "NFSN Configuration"](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108020800/http://www.mopsled.com/2015/run-nodejs-on-nearlyfreespeechnet/) in Mopsled's post)

1. Make a NearlyFreeSpeech account.
2. Create a password
3. Create a RSA key if you don't have one, run `ssh-keygen`, which generates a public and private key. You'll need the public one
4. Go to Profile > Add SSH
5. To copy your public key, run `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in the terminal
6. Paste your key into the input box, and click Add SSH Key

# Preparing my app

My app is a Vue-cli with express server: At this point I had the front end in a different folder than the backend. Two different projects with two package.jsons!

1. In my front-end project, compile the build into a /dist or /build folder
   with `npm run build`
2. Copy and paste the folder into my server side project folder (express app)
3. In my `app.js`, add `app.use(express.static ('dist/'))` to point the backend at my public directory

Optional: In `package.json`, I could add a script to run the app `run.sh`

# Deploying

(Also refer to [Project Setup](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108020800/http://www.mopsled.com/2015/run-nodejs-on-nearlyfreespeechnet/))

1. ssh to my server to get in
   `ssh username_websiteNickName>@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net`

2. To "upload" all your files to the server, copy everything into `home/protected/` by running:

   `rsync -av ./ username_websitenickname@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net:/home/protected`

   `./` indicates "everything in this folder" as the local path, and `username_websitenickname@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net:/home/protected` is the remote path.

Alternately, I could use `scp -r ./ username_websiteNickname@ssh.phx. nearlyfreespeech.net:/home/protected`

Remember to keep a space between local and destination paths.

Apparently rsync is really cool because it only updates what's changed/new in your files.

# Make It Live

3. See ["Configure NearlyFreeSpeech.net Daemon" and "Configure Proxy"] on Mopsled's post(http://www.mopsled.com/2015/run-nodejs-on-nearlyfreespeechnet/)

In a total duhh moment I found that scheduled tasks are listed in the GUI.
I went to Sites, and on the left hand side I found a sidebar listing "Scheduled Tasks" where the `tls.setup` task was listed, with a "Remove" button to the right hand side.
