A recent contract I'm on requires me to SSH into a VM running NixOS. Little did I know, its default editor is nano, and besides the repo I'm working on having a VSCode server I could SSH into with Cursor, getting around the filesystem and doing other setup required using nano, which I knew nothing about. I had also lost all my aliases and configs.

## Installing neovim

```nix
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  neovim
];
```

I decided to install Neovim, and since that worked, why not bring in LazyVim? I was in for a nightmare. As it turns out, Nix is a language, an operating system, and a package manager. Unlike the only other 2 Debian distros I had gently used, there was no `apt`.

Maybe because Nix is some penultimate meta-operating system where you can configure the hell out of the setup, there are 3+ ways to install any package:

- the authoritative Nix configuration file `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` which would install the package globally but require rebuild of the operating system
- the `nix-shell -p <package>` command which would run it as an ephemeral, isolated bash environment with the package installed for the duration of the shell
- the `nix-env` command which would install the package globally but has [some faction of users](https://stop-using-nix-env.privatevoid.net/) who claim you should never use nix-env
- Nix [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) have their own registry, `nixpkgs` and use the `nix run` command. They're also able to be committed to repos and set at the system, user or repo level. As I was on a short timeline and didn't want to impact the setup of my current project, I decided against this approach.
- other userland inventions like [`nixvim`](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/), [kickstart-nix.nvim](https://neovimcraft.com/plugin/mrcjkb/kickstart-nix.nvim/) or [`home-manager`](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) which had their own way of managing the configuration of Neovim.

There are probably more I don't know about.

Since I had used Nix for all but 2 days, I went down a rabbit hole of old forums and documentation.

As I was using 25.05 NixOS, some of the older posts contained syntax that was no longer valid.

Adding the [`vimPlugins.LazyVim`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&show=vimPlugins.LazyVim&query=lazyvim#) plugin:

```bash
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    ...
    vimPlugins.LazyVim
  ];
```

Then came the challenge of actually installing my LazyVim config, which I had already saved in my dotfiles, so I cloned, then copied my nvim/.config/nvim into my NixOS `/home/user/.config/nvim` folder.

Configuring Neovim to use my LazyVim config files:

```bash
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

programs.neovim = {
  enable = true;
  defaultEditor = true;
  viAlias = true;
  vimAlias = true;
	configure = {
	    customRC = ''

          let mapleader = "\<Space>"

          lua << EOF
            ${builtins.readFile /home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/user/.config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/user/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/user/.config/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua}
          EOF

        '';
	};
 };
```

And of course, because I'm a demented Mac user, I had to throw in [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for the shell:

```bash
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    ...
    oh-my-zsh
  ];

  programs.zsh = {
    enable = true;
    ohMyZsh = {
      enable = true;
      plugins = [ "git" "zsh-autosuggestions" "zsh-autocomplete" "direnv" ];
      theme = "robbyrussell";
    };
  };

```

Replaced the `.zshrc` and copied the folders from my custom zsh path at `/Users/user/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` into NixOS' `/home/user/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`.

And now with `exec zsh`, my auto-completions are back!

## The whole config

```bash
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
imports = [];

# ...omitted for brevity...

 programs.neovim = {
  enable = true;
  defaultEditor = true;
  viAlias = true;
  vimAlias = true;
	configure = {
	    customRC = ''

          let mapleader = "\<Space>"

          lua << EOF
            ${builtins.readFile /home/jenc/.config/nvim/init.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/jenc/.config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/jenc/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua}

            ${builtins.readFile /home/jenc/.config/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua}
          EOF

        '';
	};
 };

  system.userActivationScripts.zshrc = "touch .zshrc"; # to avoid being prompted to generate the config for the first time

  programs.direnv.enable = true;

 # Enable Zsh with Oh My Zsh
  programs.zsh = {
    enable = true;
    enableCompletion = true;
    ohMyZsh = {
      enable = true;
      plugins = [ "git" "zsh-autosuggestions" "zsh-autocomplete" "direnv" ];
      theme = "robbyrussell";
    };
  };

  # Allow proprietary packages
  nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    wget
    direnv
    gitFull
    nixfmt-rfc-style
    starship
    vim
    neovim
    zsh
    oh-my-zsh
    tree
    fzf
    vimPlugins.nvim-cmp
    vimPlugins.LazyVim
];

}

```

And then `nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.
